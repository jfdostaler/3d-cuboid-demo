# 3d-cuboid-demo
This is definitely a work in progress!

Renders a corner of a cube as a "base", and then renders a "cube-like" blob thing inside it.

The blob is randomized a little bit, so refreshing the page will draw a new, different, blob. Thing.

Renders best in Chrome (uses WebGL and three.js)
